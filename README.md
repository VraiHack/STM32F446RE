### Project-1: User Authentication Application with STM32F446RE (without interruption)
About it: a simple authentication application (using the STM32F446RE) where the user will be prompted on a serial monitor and asked to enter a Password (using 3 push button), in case of a valid password a Yellow LED turn on and a "Success" message appear on the serial monitor and if not a "Fail" message appear on the monitor.

Code Improvement: can be done from time to time but at least now you can use this code for your project and due the necessary change according to your need.
