### "Bare metal" C coding with STM32F446RE (Arduino IDE and Keil uVision)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Project-1: User Authentication with STM32F446RE (without interruption)
About it: a simple authentication application (using the STM32F446RE) where the user will be prompted on a serial monitor and asked to enter a Password (using 3 push button), in case of a valid password a Yellow LED turn on and a "Success" message appear on the serial monitor and if not a "Fail" message appear on the monitor.

Code: [Click-Me](https://github.com/VraiHack/STM32F446RE/blob/main/Project-1.ino)

Code Improvement: can be done from time to time but at least now you can use this code for your project and due the necessary change according to your need.

### Projec- 2: User Authentication with STM32F446RE (with interruption)
About it:similar to idea to project 1 but this time we are going to use peripheral interrepution.

Code started: will be available in December 2023.

### Project-3: Badge Authentication
Will be started in 2024 (planed in Mars).

### Project-4: STM32F446RE communicate with Arduino via I2C and SPI
Will be started in 2024 (no plan for it for the moment).
